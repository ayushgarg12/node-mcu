node mcu is a microcontroller.
node mcu helps NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform.
It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems,
 and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.
it is used to iot platform,.
NodeMCU was created shortly after the ESP8266 came out. On December 30, 2013, Espressif Systems[6] began production of the ESP8266.[10] The ESP8266 is a Wi-Fi SoC integrated with a Tensilica Xtensa LX106 core,[citation needed] widely used in IoT applications (see related projects). NodeMCU started on 13 Oct 2014, when Hong committed the first file of nodemcu-firmware to GitHub.[11] Two months later, the project expanded to include an open-hardware platform when developer Huang R committed the gerber file of an ESP8266 board, named devkit v0.9.[12] Later that month, Tuan PM ported MQTT client library from Contiki to the ESP8266 SoC platform,[13] and committed to NodeMCU project, then NodeMCU was able to support the MQTT IoT protocol, using Lua to access the MQTT broker. Another important update was made on 30 Jan 2015, when Devsaurus ported the u8glib[14] to NodeMCU project,[15] enabling NodeMCU to easily drive LCD, Screen, OLED, even VGA displays.

In summer 2015 the creators abandoned the firmware project and a group of independent contributors took over. By summer 2016 the NodeMCU included more than 40 different modules. Due to resource constraints users need to select the modules relevant for their project and build a firmware tailored to their needs.
